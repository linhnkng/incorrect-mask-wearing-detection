# Incorrect mask wearing detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Instructions
Pull the repo and open the Jupyter Notebook by using Terminal or Anaconda. It is highly recommended to set up a virtual environment and start installing all the requirements to avoid dependencies and conflicts.

Create a virtual environment by running this line in Terminal/Command Line: conda env create -f <environment-name>.yml

Install all required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt
